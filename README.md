## Why?

There is a significant [association between social media use and depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9103874/). Recently the surgeon general of the United States [called on congress to require warning labels](https://apnews.com/article/surgeon-general-social-media-mental-health-df321c791493863001754401676f165c). While warning labels are not a sure-fire way to curb use, they can be effective provided that:

 * The warning must provide new information to users, and 
 * The user must find the information credible
